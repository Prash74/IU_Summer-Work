1. BenchMark API Utilities
------------
This package provides an API and utilities for benchmarking various
cloud platforms.  The api is intended to support arbitrary benchmarks,
with a few constraints:

#. the actual code for a benchmark may live in its own repository and needs to be fetched
#. some environment needs to be prepared
#. a virtual cluster needs to be launched on a cloud provider
#. software needs to be deployed to the cluster, such as with ansible
#. a benchmark can be run on the cluster

2. Face Detection
------------
Build an automated face detection system to detect faces in images obtained from videos with OpenCV and big data open source software applications.

Algorithms
- OpenCV - provide face detection algorithms

- HIPI - transform image data to the format used by MapReduce function

- MongoDB Java Driver - provides interaction with MongoDB

3. HiBench Deployment
------------
HiBench-ML: Automated deployment of Intel HiBench Machine Learning benchmarks
