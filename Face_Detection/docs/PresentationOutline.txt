---MENG'S PART---

I.Project Goal

	Explore big data open source software application stacks and the archetecture.
	Acquire first-hand experience with big data applications through a project on computer vision (human face detection)  
	Gain insights into applications performance and functionality.

II. Problem Definition
	
	A. Run Open CV face / person recognition on a set of images.
	B. Run on open source big data software.
	C. Run in parallel on multiple nodes using Hadoop map reduce.
	
	
III. Useful Background Information
	I. Face/human detection with X cameras?
		a. problems...
			
			i.  Many inputs -> too much for one machine to process...
			
	II. Do it in parallel!
	III. Use open source big data software to do it!
	(footnote : for this project, will not be using streaming data, but large list of bmp images.
	
IV. Team members

	A. Meng Li
		i. Map reduce implementation
		ii. Database
	B. John Henderson
		i. OpenCV development
		ii. Configuration, deployment via Ansible
