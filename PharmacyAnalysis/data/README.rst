Example data has been loaded here with additional dir's that indicate the stage of processing of the data.


Datasets or intermediate files should be located in this directory. If original
datasets are bigger than 10MB, add a link to the file in this README file and
create a sample file which is less then 10MB and add in this directory.


TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* DO NOT ADD your large datasets in this directory
* Make sample datasets (< 10 MB)
* Add sample datasets only in this directory
* Update contents of this 'README.rst' file
* Include an address (URL or cite) of original datasets in this file
